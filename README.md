# Sberbank Capstone Project

## Overview:
This project is based on the Kaggle competition: “[Sberbank Russian Housing Market](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sberbank-russian-housing-market)”. This project is developed as a part of Capstone Project for Udacity Machine Learning NanoDegree program. The project aims to present a general structure for tackling real-world machine learning problems using powerful algorithms such as XGBoost and Multi-Layer Perceptron.

This project is divided into different notebooks, a brief rundown of the various sections is given below:
- **Part 0** [Sberbank_Exploratory_Data_Analysis](https://github.com/raoanonymous/sberbank_capstone/blob/master/Sberbank_Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb): Exploration of the raw dataset, identify anomalies/ outliers, create visualizations of different features.  
- **Part 1** [Data Cleaning](https://github.com/raoanonymous/sberbank_capstone/blob/master/Data_Clean.ipynb) and [Feature Engineering](https://github.com/raoanonymous/sberbank_capstone/blob/master/FeatureEngg.ipynb) : The handling of outliers, feature engineering based on timestamp and validation on train-test data
- **Part 2** [XGBoost Model and Tuning](https://github.com/raoanonymous/sberbank_capstone/blob/master/XGBoost.ipynb): Using the famous XGBoost library, regression model is developed by tuning important hyper-parameters
- **Part3** [MLP Model](https://github.com/raoanonymous/sberbank_capstone/blob/master/NN_Model.ipynb): Using Keras with TensorFlow library in the backend, neural network model is built. The model is check for overfitting and also using sklearn GridSearch method, hyper-parameters are tuned to get the optimal model.
